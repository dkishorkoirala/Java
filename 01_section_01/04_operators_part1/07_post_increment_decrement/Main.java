/*Post Increment/Decrement


Increment (++) and Decrement (--) operators can be used in two ways:

Pre-increment/decrement (++x or --x):

The operator goes BEFORE the variable
The value changes IMMEDIATELY
The new value is used in the expression

int x = 5;
int y = ++x;
// x is increased to 6 first, then y becomes 6
Post-increment/decrement (x++ or x--):

The operator goes AFTER the variable
The original value is used first
The value changes AFTER the expression

int x = 5;
int y = x++;
// y becomes 5 first, then x increases to 6
Another example

post-increment:

int score = 5;

int res1 = score++;
// res1 is 5
// score is 6
pre-increment:

int score = 5;

int result2 = ++score;
// res is 6
// score is 6
