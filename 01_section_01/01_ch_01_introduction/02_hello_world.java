/*Hello World!


The "Hello World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello World! to the screen.

In Java, we use System.out.println() to print output to the console. The text to be printed is placed within double quotes and enclosed in parentheses.

Let's take a look at the "Hello World!" program in Java:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

Challenge

Use the code view to write a program that outputs Hello World!

Note that anything inside quotation marks is case sensitive. For example:

System.out.println("Hello World!");
System.out.println("hello world!");
are different things (notice the capital letters in the first line).

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
